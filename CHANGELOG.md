## [2.15.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **MCP Server** (`scripts/mcp-server.sh`) — Zero-dependency Bash MCP server implementing the Agent Protocol spec:
  - JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio (no Node.js/Python required, only `jq`)
  - 6 tools: `muse_get_status`, `muse_list_roles`, `muse_get_role`, `muse_send_directive`, `muse_write_memory`, `muse_search_memory`
  - Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, or any MCP-compatible client
  - Auto-detects project root from script location
  - Security: path traversal protection, sandboxed to `.muse/` + `memory/` directories
- **MCP Config Template** (`scripts/mcp-config.json`) — Drop-in configuration for MCP clients

## [2.14.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Semantic Compression** (`/bye` Step 1) — mem0-inspired hierarchical compression for memory writes:
  - Classify work into 1-3 storylines instead of flat listing
  - Compression ratios: ≤5 turns = 1:1, 6-15 turns = 3:1, ≥16 turns = 5:1
  - Must-keep items: version changes, user decisions, file creation/deletion, external operations
- **Session Checkpoint** (`context-health-check`) — OpenViking-inspired mid-conversation auto-checkpoints:
  - Silent checkpoint every 15 turns (no user interruption)
  - Triggers: turn count, milestone events (commit/deploy), 🟡 detection, topic switch
  - Compressed format: `📍 Checkpoint` with 3-4 line snapshot appended to `memory/`
  - Complements Defensive Auto-Save: Auto-Save = crash recovery, Checkpoint = quality preservation
- **Auto Profile** (`/bye` Step 4.8) — Supermemory-inspired automatic user preference detection:
  - Detects: language, code style, work hours, tech preferences, verbosity
  - Auto-enriches `USER.md` with `(auto-detected)` tag
  - Dedup + conflict detection (never overwrites manual `/settings`)
  - Max 3 preferences per session, guardrails against over-fitting
  - `/bye` Step 6 output now includes `👤 Auto-profile` feedback line

## [2.13.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Skill Marketplace Discovery** (`scripts/skill-discovery.sh`) — CLI tool for browsing, searching, and installing MUSE skills:
  - `list` — Browse all 56 skills with tier badges (🔵 Core / 🟢 Toolkit / 🟠 Ecosystem)
  - `search <query>` — Case-insensitive keyword search across skill names and descriptions
  - `info <name>` — Detailed skill view (tier, path, lines, dependencies, description)
  - `install <name> [dir]` — Copy a skill to any project's `.agent/skills/`
  - `index` — Auto-generate `SKILL_INDEX.md` catalog with full skill listing
- **SKILL_INDEX.md** — Auto-generated skill catalog (56 skills across 3 tiers, 7 ecosystem packs)

## [2.12.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Auto Memory Capture** (`/bye` Step 4.7) — Supermemory + claude-mem-inspired real-time knowledge extraction:
  - Automatically extracts `[LESSON]` / `[DECISION]` / `[FACT]` entries from session work summaries at `/bye` time
  - Dedup check against existing MEMORIES.md (ADD / UPDATE / NOOP)
  - Token budget guard: skips capture if MEMORIES.md exceeds 2250 words
  - Guardrails: max 5 entries per session, no TODO capture (handled by role files)
  - `/bye` Step 6 output now includes `📸 Auto-capture` feedback line
- **Agent Protocol Specification** (`skills/core/agent-protocol/SKILL.md`) — MemOS-inspired machine-readable role file protocol:
  - Formalizes L0 header, section semantics, directive protocol (📡), memory protocol, and isolation rules
  - MCP server integration points: `muse_get_status`, `muse_send_directive`, `muse_auto_capture`, etc.
  - CLI and IDE plugin integration patterns
  - Multi-project cross-role communication spec
  - Core skill count: 4 → 5 (layered-context + **agent-protocol**)

## [2.11.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **L0 Layered Context Loading** — OpenViking-inspired three-layer protocol (`skills/core/layered-context/SKILL.md`):
  - Every `.muse/*.md` file now has a `<!-- L0: ... -->` one-line summary (first line)
  - `/resume` boot sequence: new Step ④.5 scans all L0 lines (~400 tokens) before deep-reading current role
  - Decision tree: L0 (quick answer) → L1 (full role file) → L2 (memory/grep on demand)
- **Enhanced `/distill` workflow** — mem0 + Supermemory-inspired improvements:
  - Structured extraction: `[FACT]` / `[DECISION]` / `[LESSON]` / `[TODO]` tags for every memory entry
  - Deduplication detection: ADD / UPDATE / NOOP against existing MEMORIES.md (from mem0's consolidation pipeline)
  - Decay detection: 30-day TTL → `[DECAY]` flag for stale entries (from Supermemory's smart forgetting)
  - Token budget: MEMORIES.md target ≤3000 tokens (~2250 words)

### Fixed
- **Skill count** — CHANGELOG v2.5.0 entry corrected from "54 skills" to "48 skills" (actual: 4 Core + 7 Ecosystem + 37 Toolkit)

## [2.10.2] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **`/bye` Step 1 context-degradation memory loss** — Root cause: Agent only remembers last ~20% of long sessions, causing `/bye` to write incomplete memory (e.g. 4-line summary for a 1469-line session). New mandatory safeguards:
  - Tool call inventory before writing memory (code edits / commands / file reads / user rounds)
  - High-risk detection: ≥10 rounds or ≥20 tool calls triggers full-conversation review
  - User statements override Agent inference ("user deleted X" ≠ "auto-fix will handle X")
  - Long sessions (≥10 rounds) must write memory grouped by time segment, not just 3-5 lines

## [2.10.1] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **`/resume` Step 2.5 cross-role mixing** — Pending items from other roles/projects no longer contaminate current role's recommendation list. Items now grouped: ① current role's items in main list ② other roles in separate `⚠️ Other Roles` section with `[ROLE]` tags
- **`/bye` Step 3.5 stale todo checkboxes** — New mandatory step: sync must update `[ ]` → `[x]` for completed items in `.muse/` files. Previously, sync only wrote summaries but never flipped checkboxes, causing next `/resume` to show completed work as pending

## [2.10.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Cross-project strategy directive path** — `/resume` now pre-checks `CLAUDE.md` for strategy.md absolute path before searching. Supports multi-project setups where strategy.md lives in a different repo
- **🟡/✅ directive filter rules** — Clear protocol: 🟡 = pending (must pull), ✅ = already received (skip). Only the target role's `/resume` can mark ✅. Prevents Strategy accidentally marking directives as delivered before they're pulled
- **`/bye` mandatory `ls` three-step method** — Convo filename generation now enforces: Step 5a (determine date) → Step 5b (run `ls` command, never guess) → Step 5c (assemble filename). Eliminates sequence number collisions

### Fixed
- **`/resume` cross-project directive mismatch** — Was searching local `.muse/strategy.md` (doesn't exist in satellite projects). Now reads absolute path from `CLAUDE.md` Project-Specific Rules (S035)
- **`/bye` convo sequence number guessing** — Agent would default to `-01-` without checking existing files. Now MUST run `ls convo/YYMMDD/` — skipping = execution failure (S035)
- **Strategy directive loss** — Directives marked ✅ at creation time were invisible to target roles. New rule: Strategy MUST use 🟡 when creating directives (S035)

### Changed
- **Demo animation remade** — 85 frames, 17 seconds. Shows full MUSE workflow: `/resume` → boot sequence → work → `/ctx` → `/bye`
- **.gitignore** — Added `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json`

## [2.9.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **`/bye` Iron Rule** — Mandatory 6-step execution enforcement. Agent can no longer skip SOP steps or give short summaries instead of full sync+memory+archive
- **Memory System Declaration** — Explicit declaration that MUSE uses `.muse/*.md` role files, NOT trio-status-sop (`STATUS.md`). Prevents erroneous file creation
- **Complete Project-Role Routing Table** — 13-combination routing table (3 projects × 4+ roles) mapping each conversation type to its correct `.muse/` sync target
- **`/bye` Step 5 CAUTION block** — Convo export step explicitly marked as non-skippable

### Fixed
- **`/bye` not auto-executing SOP** — Agent would give brief summary and stop. Now enforced with `NEVER skip` iron rule language
- **`/bye` creating wrong status files** — Agent confused trio-status-sop SKILL with MUSE role system, creating `STATUS.md` / `MARKETING_STATUS.md` in project roots. Now explicitly banned
- **`/bye` missing project routing** — Only had 5 identity types. Now has 13 with fallback rules

## [2.8.1] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **[nah](https://github.com/manuelscgipper/nah) recommended companion** — Context-aware permission guard for Claude Code. Added to README, README_CN, install.sh post-install tip, and Credits section
- **P1 features** — Cursor rules generator (`scripts/generate-cursorrules.sh`), skill dependency declarations, memory archive lifecycle
- **GEO/SEO skill** in CLAUDE.md template speed reference table

### Fixed
- **MUSE project routing** — Added missing MUSE project routes to `resume.md` (only DYA/Prometheus had routes)
- **Cursor rules generator** — Target dir validation fix

## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Multi-tool installer** (`scripts/install.sh`) — One command to install MUSE on any supported AI coding tool:
  - **Claude Code / OpenClaw**: `.agent/skills/` + `CLAUDE.md` (native format)
  - **Cursor**: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (YAML frontmatter with `alwaysApply`)
  - **Windsurf**: `.windsurf/rules/*.md` (activation comments)
  - **Gemini CLI**: `.gemini/skills/` + `GEMINI.md` (native skill format)
  - **Codex CLI**: `AGENTS.md` (single concatenated file)
- Auto-detection of installed tools (`--list`)
- Interactive + CLI modes (`--tool`, `--target`, `--core-only`)
- README.md + README_CN.md: Added tool support table and multi-tool quick start (Option B)

## [2.7.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **QA↔BUILD sync gap** — `/sync receive` in BUILD now checks `build.md` itself for QA→BUILD notifications (previously only checked `strategy.md` + `qa.md`, missing QA broadcasts entirely)
- **`/resume build` dual QA check** — Now checks both `qa.md` for FAIL reports AND `build.md` for QA→BUILD notifications
- **QA broadcast format standardized** — Fixed section header (`📡 QA→BUILD 通知`) + searchable marker (`🟡 待 BUILD 处理`) so agents can grep-find notifications
- **QA iron rule #7: READ-ONLY** — QA must never modify source code directly; only report bugs and route to BUILD via standard notification format
- **Search keyword reference table** — Added to `sync.md` so agents know exactly what to grep for each notification type

## [2.7.1] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Auto QA Re-Verify** — `/resume qa` auto-detects FAIL items from `qa.md` "Pending Re-Verify" section and re-verifies them. User just types `/resume qa` — zero manual input
- **qa.md template** — Added "Pending Re-Verify" section for structured FAIL item tracking

### Fixed
- **`/settings language` enforcement** — Language changes now MUST update `CLAUDE.md` Iron Rule #1 (not just `USER.md`). Added `[!CAUTION]` block + verify step + immediate language switch. Prevents silent language change failures
- **MUSE repo self-configuration** — Added `.agent/` symlinks, `memory/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `MEMORIES.md` so the MUSE repo itself works as a MUSE workspace

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **`/settings` command** — Unified preference management: language, AI model, docs convention, code style. Replaces `/model` (backward-compatible alias kept)
- **Pre-Flight Check in `/resume`** — Detects missing `CLAUDE.md` / `USER.md` / `memory/` / `.muse/` and redirects to `/start` instead of crashing
- **Mid-Conversation Sync** — `/sync receive` pulls updates from other roles without ending the conversation (e.g., build pulls QA results live)
- **`/start` in README Commands** — First-time setup now prominently listed

### Changed
- **`resume.md` fully genericized** — Removed all DYA/Prometheus hardcoded tables and paths. Now works for any project out of the box
- **`resume.md` rewritten in English** — All instructions localized to English for open-source users
- **`start.md` updated** — Added `/settings` to command tutorial and post-setup notes
- **`setup.sh` updated** — Next steps now mention `/start` and `/settings`
- **README.md + README_CN.md** — Commands table updated with `/start`, `/settings`, `/sync receive`

### Removed
- **`model.md`** — Replaced by `/settings` (which handles model + language + docs + code style)
## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **QA System v2.0** — Complete rewrite of `qa.md` with:
  - 🚀 Quick Start guide (3 launch methods: Strategy-assigned / Build-completed / Pre-release regression)
  - 📋 7-step SOP (AC source → environment → verify → error paths → report → judge → routing)
  - 📝 3 complete use cases with step-by-step examples
  - 📡 Result routing table (PASS/FAIL → where to write, who to notify)
- **`/resume [project] qa`** — New QA-specific resume route in `resume.md`
- **Quick Start sections** — Added to all role files (`build.md`, `growth.md`, `ops.md`, `research.md`, `fundraise.md`)
- **QA routes in MUSE.md** — `/resume qa` and `/resume prometheus qa` in routing table

### Fixed
- **`bye.md` convo naming bug** — Replaced hardcoded example date with dynamic rules (use current date, check folder for max sequence number). Added ❌/✅ error/correct examples
- **`resume.md` memory scanning** — Now detects `🔲` + `- [ ]` + `➡️ 下一步` items (was only `🔲`)
- **`bye.md` distill detection** — Improved MEMORIES.md timestamp check (stat + grep dual method)

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-12
